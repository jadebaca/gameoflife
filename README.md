Conway's game is a cellular automata (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton)
game invented in 1970. The game takes place on an innite 2-d grid, in which each space of
the grid represents a cell. A set of rules is applied to each cell of the current generation in
order to determine what cells live or die in the next generation.
